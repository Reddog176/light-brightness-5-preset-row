Provides a means to program 3 preset brightness settings for dimmable lights selectable from a Lovelace button row.

This pluig-in was inspired by user @jazzyisj on the Home Assistant forum (community.home-assistant.io) as a thematically complementary plug-in for my fan control row.

This element is completely theme-able to provide a match to the "fan-control-entity-row" to provide a consistent look for the different elements in your Lovelace frontend

This is with the default Lovelace frontend theme set:

This is with the "Slate" frontend theme set:
